## 1. Application and Incorporation

This Data Processing Agreement ("DPA") is incorporated into and forms part of the [Terms of Service](/legal/terms). By accepting the Terms of Service, the Account Owner agrees to this DPA on behalf of the Account.

This DPA governs our processing of Personal Data that the Account uploads or submits to the Service for processing on the Account's behalf. This includes data about the Account's Users (typically employees or other individuals) where the Account determines the purposes and means of processing.

Note: This DPA does not apply to Personal Data we collect directly about Accounts and Users, or Service usage for our own purposes (analytics, service improvement, security). For that processing, we are the data controller and our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy) applies.

---

## 2. Definitions

This DPA uses the definitions from the [Terms of Service](/legal/terms). Additional terms specific to this DPA:

**Controller:** The Account using the Service, which determines the purposes and means of processing Personal Data uploaded to or processed through the Service.

**Processor:** Us, the Service provider, processing Personal Data on behalf of the Controller according to the Controller's instructions.

**Personal Data:** Information relating to an identified or identifiable individual, as defined by applicable Data Protection Laws.

**Data Protection Laws:** Laws and regulations governing the processing of Personal Data, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ("GDPR") and other applicable privacy and data protection laws.

**Data Subject:** An individual whose Personal Data is processed under this DPA.

**Sub-Processor:** Any third party we engage to process Personal Data on behalf of the Controller.

## 3. Scope and Purpose

This DPA governs our processing of Personal Data on the Account's behalf in connection with the provision of the Service.

The subject matter, duration, nature and purpose of processing, types of Personal Data, categories of Data Subjects, and processing operations are described in Schedule 1.

---

## 4. Our Obligations as Processor

We shall:

- Process Personal Data only on the Account's documented instructions (through the Account's use and configuration of the Service). If we are required by applicable law to process Personal Data without the Account's instructions, we will inform the Account of that legal requirement before processing

- Immediately notify the Account if, in our opinion, an instruction from the Account infringes applicable Data Protection Laws.

- Ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data are committed to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.

- Implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures as described in Section 7 and Schedule 3.

- Engage Sub-Processors only as authorized in Section 5 and Schedule 2.

- Assist the Account in responding to Data Subject rights requests as described in Section 6.

- Assist the Account in ensuring compliance with security obligations, data breach notification requirements, and data protection impact assessments under applicable Data Protection Laws.

- Retain and delete Personal Data as described in Section 11 and our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy).

- Make available to the Account all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with our obligations under this DPA and applicable Data Protection Laws.

The Account remains responsible for ensuring it has a valid legal basis for any Personal Data it uploads to or processes through the Service. We are not responsible for the Account's compliance with Data Protection Laws in its capacity as Controller.

---

## 5. Sub-Processors

By accepting this DPA, the Account authorizes us to engage the Sub-Processors listed in Schedule 2 to process Personal Data on the Account's behalf.

We shall:

- Provide at least 14 days advance notice before engaging new Sub-Processors or replacing existing Sub-Processors via email to the Account Owner's registered email address

- Ensure that Sub-Processors are bound by written agreements imposing data protection obligations substantially similar to those in this DPA

- Remain fully liable to the Account for the performance of Sub-Processor obligations under this DPA

The Account may object to the engagement of a new Sub-Processor on reasonable data protection grounds by contacting us at legal@example.com within the 14-day notice period. If the Account objects and we cannot provide an alternative solution, the Account may terminate the Service as described in the [Terms of Service](/legal/terms).

---

## 6. Data Subject Rights

We shall assist the Account in fulfilling its obligations to respond to requests from Data Subjects exercising their rights under applicable Data Protection Laws, including rights to access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and objection to processing.

Data deletion is performed at the Account level as described in Section 11. We do not delete data for individual Users while the Account remains active.

We shall notify the Account without undue delay upon receiving a Data Subject request submitted directly to us by one of the Account's Users or customers.

---

## 7. Security Measures

We implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect Personal Data from unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

Security measures are described in Schedule 3. We will review and update these measures regularly to maintain appropriate security levels as technology and threats evolve.

## 9. International Data Transfers

Personal Data processed under this DPA is stored within the Azure region selected during Account creation and is not transferred outside that region.

Pseudonymized analytics data is processed within the EU region. For Accounts located outside the EU, analytics data will be transferred from the local region to our EU-based Azure Application Insights instance for centralized processing. These transfers are protected by Microsoft's Data Processing Agreement incorporating Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission where required by applicable data protection laws.

Information about transfer safeguards and Standard Contractual Clauses are available on our [Legal and Compliance](/legal/) page.

## 10. Audit and Compliance Information

Compliance information, security documentation, and audit reports are available on our [Legal and Compliance](/legal/) page.

The Account may request additional compliance information once per year by contacting legal@example.com

---

## 11. Data Retention and Deletion

This DPA remains in effect for as long as the Account is active and we process Personal Data on the Account's behalf.

Data retention and deletion after Account termination or cancellation is described in our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy). This includes retention periods, deletion timelines, and Account Owner deletion requests.

Note: Data deletion is performed at the Account level. We do not delete data for individual Users while the Account remains active.

---

## 12. Limitation of Liability

Our liability for breaches of this DPA is governed by the limitation of liability provisions in the [Terms of Service](/legal/terms), except that nothing in this DPA limits our liability for violations of applicable Data Protection Laws that cannot be limited by contract.

---

## 13. Governing Law and Disputes

This DPA is governed by and subject to the governing law and dispute resolution provisions set forth in the [Terms of Service](/legal/terms).

---

## 14. Amendments

We may update this DPA and the attached Schedules to reflect changes in our processing activities, Sub-Processors, security measures, or applicable legal requirements.

Material changes to this DPA will be communicated with at least 14 days advance notice via email to the Account Owner's registered email address. Material changes include modifications to data processing purposes, Sub-Processor additions, or reductions in data protection safeguards.

By continuing to use the Service after the effective date of changes, the Account accepts the updated DPA. If the Account does not agree to material changes, it may terminate the Service as described in the [Terms of Service](/legal/terms).
