## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By creating an Account, accessing, or using this Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy). If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms.

If you do not agree to these Terms, you are not authorized to access or use the Service.

## 2. Service Description

We provide a cloud-based software platform. The specific features and functionality available to you depend on your subscription plan.

Service availability commitments, if any, are specified in your subscription plan. Except where specified in your subscription plan, we do not guarantee specific uptime percentages.

## 3. Payment Terms

All fees are non-refundable. Payment is due in advance for each billing period.

If payment fails, your access to the Service will be suspended until payment is processed. We will send notifications to the Account Owner's registered email address. Your data will be retained during payment suspension and your Account will be reactivated once payment is resolved.

Payment suspension is not considered a cancellation and does not trigger data deletion. If payment remains unresolved for an extended period, we may treat the Account as cancelled. Data retention and deletion is described in our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy).

## 4. Business Accounts and Authorization

When you create an Account, you become the Account Owner. As the Account Owner:

- You accept these Terms of Service and our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy) on behalf of the Account and all Users within the Account
- You are responsible for ensuring that Users within the Account comply with these Terms
- You are responsible for all activity that occurs within the Account
- You may invite additional Users and assign roles and permissions within the Account
- You may delegate invite permissions to Account Administrators

Users invited to an Account acknowledge that the Account Owner has accepted these Terms on their behalf. By using the Service, invited Users agree to be bound by these Terms.

## 5. User Accounts

All Users are responsible for:

- Maintaining the security of their account credentials
- Their conduct and activities within the Account
- Notifying the Account Owner immediately of any unauthorized access
- Providing accurate information

The Account Owner is responsible for all activities that occur within the Account by any User.

## 6. Acceptable Use

The Account Owner agrees on behalf of all Users within the Account that no User will:

- Use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable laws
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of the Service
- Interfere with or disrupt the Service or servers
- Upload malicious code or content that infringes intellectual property rights
- Use the Service to send spam or unsolicited communications
- Resell or redistribute the Service without authorization

Violation of this Acceptable Use policy may result in immediate suspension or termination of your Account at our sole discretion, as described in Section 11.

You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your use of the Service, your content, or your violation of these Terms.

## 7. Data Processing and Privacy

We collect and process data as described in our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy), which forms part of these Terms. By using this Service, you acknowledge that:

- We track usage activity to improve our Service under the legal basis of legitimate interest
- Account Owners and Account Administrators have access to usage data and activity within the Account
- We act as a data processor for business data you upload to the Service

Our data processing relationship is governed by our [Data Processing Agreement](/legal/dpa), which complies with GDPR Article 28 requirements and is incorporated into these Terms.

## 8. Intellectual Property

The Service, including its original content, features, and functionality, is owned by us and protected by copyright and other applicable intellectual property laws.

Your data remains yours. We claim no ownership over the content you upload to the Service. By using the Service, you grant us a license to:

- Use your data to provide the Service to you
- Create and use aggregated, anonymized, or pseudonymized data derived from your usage to improve our Service, develop new features, train machine learning models, create analytics products, and support our business operations including marketing and sales insights
- Use patterns and insights from your business data (in anonymized or pseudonymized form) to benefit our Service and our business, such as classification models, recommendations, service optimizations, and aggregate market analysis

We will not share your identifiable data between Accounts except where you explicitly choose to do so through features we provide (such as sharing documents or collaborating across Accounts). We will not use the specific content of your business data (such as document text or order details) for purposes beyond providing the Service to you.

## 9. Disclaimer of Warranties

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

Our total aggregate liability arising out of or related to these Terms or the Service shall not exceed the total amount you paid us in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to liability.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from:

- Your use or inability to use the Service
- Any unauthorized access to or use of our servers
- Any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Service
- Any bugs or harmful code transmitted through the Service by third parties or Users

Nothing in these Terms limits liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, violations of data protection laws, or any liability that cannot be excluded under applicable law.

## 11. Cancellation and Termination

If you cancel your subscription, you may continue to use the Service until the end of your current billing period. Data retention and deletion after cancellation is described in our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy).

We may suspend your access immediately, without prior notice, for conduct that violates these Terms or is harmful to other Users, us, or third parties. During suspension, your data is retained but not accessible.

We may terminate your Account for repeated or serious violations. Upon termination, data retention and deletion follows our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy).

## 12. Modifications to Terms

We may revise these Terms to reflect changes in our Service, new features, or legal requirements. For material changes, we will provide at least 14 days notice before the new terms take effect by posting a notice on the Service or sending you an email.

Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of the revised Terms constitutes your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop using the Service.

## 13. Governing Law and Disputes

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Denmark, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising from these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Copenhagen, Denmark.

## 14. General Provisions

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

These Terms, together with our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy) and [Data Processing Agreement](/legal/dpa), constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service.

You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets with notice to you.

We will not be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control.
