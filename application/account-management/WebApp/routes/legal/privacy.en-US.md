## 1. Information We Collect

We collect information that you provide directly to us, including:

We also automatically collect usage data when you use our Service, including:

- Application usage (pages visited, features used, interaction patterns, time spent, etc.)
- Device and technical information (browser, operating system, app version, etc.)
- Location data (country, state, city, etc. derived from connection)
- User and Account metadata (subscription plans, feature flags, roles, settings, etc.)
- Business activity data (entity types, state changes, user actions, etc.) for analytics
- Communications data (messages, chat conversations, etc. where applicable)

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide, maintain, and improve our Service
- Process transactions and send related information
- Send technical notices and support messages
- Respond to your comments and questions
- Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities to improve our Service
- Detect and prevent security issues and abuse

## 3. Legal Basis for Processing

For Users in the European Economic Area (EEA), we process Personal Data under the following legal bases:

- **Contractual necessity**: To provide the Service
- **Legitimate interest**: To analyze usage patterns and improve our Service (see Section 8)
- **Legal obligation**: To comply with applicable laws and regulations
- **Consent**: Where required, such as for marketing communications

## 4. Information Sharing and Data Processors

We may share information in the following circumstances:

- With consent
- To comply with legal obligations
- To protect our rights and prevent fraud
- In aggregated or anonymized form

We use the following data processors to operate our Service:

- **Microsoft Azure**: Cloud infrastructure and services
- **Azure Application Insights**: Analytics and performance monitoring
- **Stripe**: Payment processing (where applicable)

These processors are contractually bound to protect data and process it only according to our instructions. Our data processing relationship is governed by a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) that complies with GDPR Article 28 requirements. Our DPA template is publicly available at [/legal/dpa](/legal/dpa)

## 5. Data Security

We implement technical and organizational security measures to protect Personal Data including encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest, role-based access controls, and regular security assessments.

In the event of a data breach that poses a risk to rights and freedoms, we will notify the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours and notify affected Users without undue delay as required by GDPR Articles 33 and 34.

## 6. Data Retention

We retain your data for as long as your Account is active.

When your subscription ends, we retain your data for at least 60 days. We may continue to retain your data at our discretion, which allows you to reactivate your Account. If we decide to delete your data, we will provide reasonable advance notice to the Account Owner's registered email address.

You may request deletion at any time after your subscription ends using the in-app deletion function. Deletion takes 60 to 90 days to complete.

Pseudonymized analytics data is retained for the duration of Service operations to analyze long-term trends and improve our Service. This data contains technical identifiers but is separated from Account information and cannot be linked to individual Users.

## 7. Your Rights

Under applicable data protection laws, Users have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing of, and object to processing of Personal Data, as well as the right to data portability. Users also have the right to lodge a complaint with their data protection authority.

Contact us at legal@example.com to exercise these rights. We will respond within one month.

Individual User data deletion is not available while the Account remains active because User data is part of the Account's business records (audit trails, contributions, activity history). Users can be deactivated by Account Owners to remove access. Full data deletion requires Account cancellation. Pseudonymized analytics data cannot be deleted.

## 8. Analytics and Legitimate Interest

We use first-party analytics to understand how Users interact with our Service. This helps us identify issues, improve features, and provide a better experience.

We track usage activity under the legal basis of legitimate interest. We have conducted a Legitimate Interest Assessment documenting that this processing is necessary for product improvement, does not involve sensitive data, and is balanced against user expectations in a B2B service context.

## 9. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

We use artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies extensively to provide and improve the Service:

**AI-Powered Features:**
- Automated classification and data processing (such as document categorization, data extraction, and pattern recognition)
- Intelligent recommendations and insights based on your data and usage patterns
- Automated analysis and suggestions to assist Users in making decisions
- AI-powered customer support (analyzing system logs, providing assistance, escalating to humans when needed)

**Machine Learning and Model Training:**

We train machine learning models using data processed through the Service to improve accuracy, provide better recommendations, and enhance Service functionality. This includes:

- Training models on your Account data to provide personalized features and recommendations
- Using aggregated, pseudonymized data across multiple Accounts to improve model accuracy and provide industry insights (we do not share identifiable data between Accounts)
- Analyzing usage patterns and analytics data to improve Service quality, identify issues, and develop new features
- Using system telemetry and error logs to enhance automated support capabilities

**User Control and Responsibility:**

AI features provide suggestions and recommendations that assist Users in making decisions. Users retain full control and responsibility for reviewing, approving, overriding, or rejecting AI suggestions, particularly for actions with legal or financial implications. AI recommendations should be verified before being relied upon for important decisions.

**Data Usage for AI:**

We use your data to train and improve AI models as described in the [Terms of Service](/legal/terms). We do not sell your data or share identifiable information between Accounts. When we use data across Accounts to improve models, it is aggregated and pseudonymized so individual Accounts cannot be identified.

**Legal Basis:**

AI processing of your data is performed under our contract with you (to provide AI-powered Service features) and our legitimate interest in improving the Service. Cross-account aggregated learning is performed under legitimate interest, as documented in our Legitimate Interest Assessment, and does not involve sharing your identifiable data with other Accounts.

## 10. Cookies and Local Storage

We use cookies and browser storage technologies for the following purposes:

- Authentication tokens and session management
- User preferences and application state (language, theme, UI layout preferences, etc.)
- Security features
- Service functionality and performance monitoring

By using our Service, you acknowledge that we use these technologies as described above.

## 11. Business Accounts

When using the Service through an Account created by someone else, the Account Owner has agreed to our [Terms of Service](/legal/terms) and this Privacy Policy on behalf of all Users within that Account.

Account Owners and Account Administrators have access to usage data and activity within the Account and can manage Account and User settings.

## 12. International Data Transfers

Personal and business data is stored within the Azure region selected when signing up and is not transferred outside that region.

Pseudonymized analytics data (Azure Application Insights telemetry) is processed within the EU region. For customers located outside the EU, your analytics data will be transferred from your local region to our EU-based Azure Application Insights instance for centralized processing. These transfers are protected by Microsoft's Data Processing Agreement incorporating Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission.

You have the right to obtain information about these safeguards and request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us.

## 13. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices, new features, or legal requirements. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the revised policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. For material changes, we will provide at least 14 days notice before the changes take effect. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

## 14. Data Protection Authority

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority if you believe we have not complied with applicable data protection laws.

## 15. Governing Law

This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of Denmark.

## 16. California Residents

We do not sell or share Personal Data as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The rights described in Section 7 apply to all Users, including California residents.
