# Frontend for team management

**Purpose:**

This increment implements the Teams page UI with the ability to:
- List, create, edit, and delete teams using the API from the first increment
- Display teams in a table with team data
- Create new teams via modal dialog
- View and edit team details in a side pane
- Implement appropriate loading and empty states
- Apply permission-based UI controls
- Add Teams menu item to the Organization section of navigation

**NOT included:**
- Backend implementation (previous increment)
- Team membership management (separate increment)
- Advanced filtering/sorting
- Pagination and search functionality

**Dependencies:**
- Backend for team management increment must be completed first

**IMPORTANT:**
Do not modify any backend code or implement team membership functionality in this increment.

## CRITICAL: Frontend vertical slice requirements

**EACH TASK = ONE COMMIT = ONE COMPLETE UI FEATURE**

A vertical slice in frontend means:
- Component + API integration + UI state + user interaction = ONE task/commit
- The UI must be functional and testable after EACH task
- Never split component creation, API calls, and state management into separate tasks

**Example of WRONG approach (multiple commits):**
- Task 1: Create table component structure ❌
- Task 2: Add API data fetching ❌
- Task 3: Connect data to table ❌
- Task 4: Add loading states ❌
- Task 5: Add error handling ❌

**Example of RIGHT approach (vertical slice):**
- Task 1: Create teams table with data fetching and loading states ✅
  (Complete working table in ONE commit)
