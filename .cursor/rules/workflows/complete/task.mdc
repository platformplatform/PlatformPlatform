# Complete Task Workflow

**For Worker Agents Only**: backend-engineer, frontend-engineer, test-automation-engineer

This command signals to the Worker Host that you have completed your task. It will write your response file and terminate your session.

## When to Use This

Call `/complete-task` when:
- You have successfully completed the task
- You are stuck and cannot make progress (so Worker Host can restart you)
- You have been inactive and received a restart reminder

## Workflow

1. **Prepare your response content**:
   - Write a comprehensive response describing what you accomplished
   - Include any important notes or context for the Tech Lead
   - Format as markdown

2. **Determine task summary**:
   - Brief sentence case summary (e.g., "Api endpoints implemented", "User authentication added")
   - Do NOT include task numbers or dates
   - Keep it descriptive and natural

3. **Call MCP CompleteTask tool**:
   ```
   Use the MCP CompleteTask tool with these parameters:
   - agentType: Your agent type (backend-engineer, frontend-engineer, or test-automation-engineer)
   - taskSummary: Your brief summary from step 2
   - responseContent: Your full response from step 1
   ```

4. **Important**: After calling the MCP tool, your session will be terminated immediately. The MCP tool writes the response file and kills your process.

## Example

If you just implemented API endpoints for user management:

**Task Summary**: "User management endpoints implemented"

**Response Content**:
```markdown
# User Management Endpoints Implementation

## Changes Made
- Created GET /users endpoint
- Created POST /users endpoint
- Added validation logic
- Updated API documentation

## Testing
All endpoint tests passing.
```

Then call: `MCP CompleteTask` with those parameters.

## Remember

The MCP tool will:
- Write your response to `/messages/{task-id}.{agent-type}.response.{summary}.md`
- Terminate your session
- Signal completion to Worker Host
