# Complete Review Workflow

**For Reviewer Agents Only**: backend-reviewer, frontend-reviewer, test-automation-reviewer

This command signals to the Worker Host that you have completed your review. It will write your response file and terminate your session.

## When to Use This

Call `/complete-review` when:
- You have finished reviewing and reached a decision (approved or rejected)
- You are stuck and cannot make progress
- You have been inactive and received a restart reminder

## Workflow

1. **Make your decision**: Approved or Rejected?

2. **Prepare comprehensive review feedback** in markdown format

3. **Determine brief summary** in sentence case (e.g., "Excellent implementation", "Missing test coverage")

4. **Call MCP CompleteReview tool** with:
   - agentType: Your agent type (backend-reviewer, frontend-reviewer, or test-automation-reviewer)
   - approved: true if approved, false if rejected
   - reviewSummary: Your brief summary
   - responseContent: Your full review feedback

Your session will terminate immediately after calling the tool.

## Example - Approved
