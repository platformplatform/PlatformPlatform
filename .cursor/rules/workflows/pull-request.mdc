# Pull Request Workflow

Follow these steps to create pull request titles and descriptions:

1. Before creating a pull request, gather context by inspecting the changes:
   - Get the full list of commits: `git --no-pager log --format=%s --reverse $(git merge-base HEAD main)..HEAD`
   - View the full diff: `git --no-pager diff main`
   - If needed, examine specific files for more context.

2. Create a pull request title that is:
   - In imperative form ("Fix", "Add", "Upgrade", "Refactor", etc.)
   - Written as a sentence (not in Title Case).
   - Without a period at the end.

3. Write a clear description that:
   - Starts with an explanation of what the change does and why it was made.
   - Focuses on the functional impact of the change without overselling.
   - Do not use the term "Pull Request", "PR", or any abbreviation of it.
   - Do not use personal pronouns such as "we", "our", "he", "she".
   - DO NOT end the pull request description summarizing the benefits of the changes.
     - Adding a such a summary at the end is the most common reason pull request descriptions are not accepted.

4. Always use the official pull request template [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](mdc:.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) which includes:
   - **Summary & Motivation**: Start with the most important change, use bullet points for multiple changes, and mention minor fixes last.
   - **Checklist**: Do not change the checklist from .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md, and do not [x] the list, as this should be a manual task.

5. Only for pull requests to the "PlatformPlatform Upstream repository" add a `### Downstream projects` section if needed:
   - Downstream projects integrate all pull requests from the PlatformPlatform Upstream repository into their own downstream repository, which typically has one extra self-contained system.
   - If the file [application/PlatformPlatform.slnx](mdc:application/PlatformPlatform.slnx) exists, this is the "PlatformPlatform Upstream repository". In downstream projects, the Visual Studio solution file has been renamed.
   - Include this section only when changes require modifications in downstream projects.
   - A sign that this is needed is when:
     - Similar changes have been made across the two self-contained systems [Account Management](mdc:application/account-management) and [Back Office](mdc:application/back-office).
     - Similar changes have been made to workflow files [account-management.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/account-management.yml) and [back-office.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/back-office.yml).
     - Breaking changes have been made to shared components (typically in `application/shared-kernel` or `application/shared-webapp`), that might require changes in downstream projects.
     - Updates to NuGet or npm packages required changes to [Account Management](mdc:application/account-management) and [Back Office](mdc:application/back-office) that also needed to be applied to other self-contained systems.
   - Use direct, specific language when addressing what needs to be done, e.g., "Please update your custom configuration to match these changes:"
   - Avoid phrases like "Downstream projects should" or "Downstream projects must" - use more direct phrasing.
   - Use a numbered list for multiple changes, make it clear if multiple changes are required.
   - Be very specific about the changes needed.
     - Often any changes to [Back Office](mdc:application/back-office) are 1:1 with the changes that need to be applied to downstream self-contained systems.
   - Include exact filenames, code snippets, and Git diffs as needed.
   - Use the placeholder term `your-self-contained-system` for downstream implementations.

## Examples

### Example 1 - Pull Request Title

```
# ✅ DO: Use imperative form, sentence case, no period
Add user profile image upload functionality
Fix data protection key sharing between SCSs
Update dependency versions to latest stable releases

# ❌ DON'T: Use past tense, title case, periods, or be vague
Added User Profile Image Upload Functionality.
Fixed a bug
Updating dependencies
PR: Implement new feature
```

### Example 2 - Pull Request Description

```markdown
### Summary & Motivation

Add data protection key sharing between self-contained systems to fix antiforgery token validation failures. Previously, each self-contained system had isolated encryption keys, causing tokens generated in one system to be invalid in another.

- Configure a common application name ("PlatformPlatform") for all SCSs.
- Store keys in a user-accessible directory on disk.

# ✅ DO: Correctly NOT adding a short summary of the benefits here!!!

### Downstream projects

1. Update `your-self-contained-system/Api/Program.cs` to use the shared data protection keys. # ✅ DO: use `your-self-contained-system` to reference downstream system

# ✅ DO: Use Git diff syntax to show what should be changed
```diff
- // No shared data protection configuration
+ // Configure shared data protection keys
+ builder.Services
+     .AddDataProtection()
+     .PersistKeysToFileSystem(new DirectoryInfo(Path.Combine(".platformplatform", "dataprotection-keys")));
```

### Checklist # ✅ DO: Correctly add the check points from PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md without setting the [x]

- [ ] I have added tests, or done manual regression tests
- [ ] I have updated the documentation, if necessary
```

```markdown
### Summary

# ❌ DON'T: Use "we" and "our" personal pronouns, use past tense, use banned "pull request" term,  use scs acronyms, and add vague descriptions.
In this pull request we fixed a bug causing issues in our scs's.

- We added some configuration.
- Fixed a bug.

These changes make the system more robust and maintainable. # ❌ DON'T: Create short summary statements to finish the description. Skip this line

### Checklist  # ❌ DON'T: Use made up checklist

- [x] Code follows the style guidelines of the project
- [x] Changes have been tested locally
```
