# E2E Testing Workflow

Feature or product increment: $ARGUMENTS

If a product increment file is provided in the arguments above, read it to understand what features need testing. This workflow guides you through the process of creating comprehensive end-to-end tests for those features. It focuses on identifying what tests to write, planning complex scenarios, and ensuring tests follow the established conventions.

## Workflow

1. Understand the feature under test:
   - Study the frontend components and their interactions.
   - Review API endpoints and authentication flows.
   - Understand validation rules and error handling.
   - Identify key user interactions and expected behaviors.

2. Use Browser MCP to explore the webapp functionality:
   - Navigate to the application: `mcp0_browser_navigate({ url: "https://localhost:9000" })`.
   - Interact with the feature manually to understand user flows.
   - Take snapshots to identify UI elements and their structure.
   - Document key interactions and expected behaviors.
   - Note any edge cases or potential issues discovered during exploration.

3. Review existing test examples:
   - Read [End-to-End Tests](mdc:.cursor/rules/end-to-end-tests/e2e-tests.mdc) for detailed information.
   - Examine [signup.spec.ts](mdc:application/account-management/WebApp/tests/e2e/signup.spec.ts) and [login.spec.ts](mdc:application/account-management/WebApp/tests/e2e/login.spec.ts) for inspiration.
   - Note the structure, assertions, test organization, and the "Act & Assert:" comment format.

4. Plan comprehensive test scenarios:
   - Identify standard user journeys through the feature.
   - Plan for complex multi-session scenarios like:
     - Concurrent sessions: What happens when a user has two tabs open?
     - Cross-session state changes: What happens when state changes in one session affect another?
     - Authentication conflicts: How does the system handle authentication changes across sessions?
     - Form submissions across sessions: What happens with concurrent form submissions?
     - Antiforgery token handling: How are antiforgery tokens managed across tabs?
     - Browser navigation: Back/forward buttons, refresh, direct URL access.
     - Network conditions: Slow connections, disconnections during operations.
     - Input validation: Boundary values, special characters, extremely long inputs.
     - Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility.
     - Localization: Testing with different languages and formats.

5. Categorize tests appropriately:
   - `@smoke`: Essential functionality that will run on deployment of any system.
     - Create one comprehensive smoke.spec.ts per self-contained system.
     - Test complete user journeys: signup → profile setup → invite users → manage roles → tenant settings → logout.
     - Include validation errors, retries, and recovery scenarios within the journey.
   - `@comprehensive`: More thorough tests covering edge cases that will run on deployment of the system under test.
     - Focus on specific feature areas with deep testing of edge cases.
     - Group related scenarios to minimize test count while maximizing coverage.
   - `@slow`: Tests involving timeouts or waiting periods that will run ad-hoc, when features under test are changed.

6. Create or update test structure:
   - For smoke tests: Create/update `application/[scs-name]/WebApp/tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts`.
   - For comprehensive tests: Create feature-specific files like `user-management-flows.spec.ts`, `team-management-flows.spec.ts`.
   - Avoid creating many small, isolated tests - prefer comprehensive scenarios that test multiple aspects.

7. **CRITICAL - Run watch tool to apply database migrations**:
   - Use **watch MCP tool** to restart server and run migrations
   - This MUST be done before running tests if backend schema changed
   - The tool starts .NET Aspire at https://localhost:9000

8. **CRITICAL - Run tests and verify they pass**:
   - Use **e2e MCP tool** to run your tests
   - Start with smoke tests: `e2e(smoke=true)`
   - Then run comprehensive tests with search terms: `e2e(searchTerms=["feature-name"])`
   - **ALL tests MUST pass** before proceeding
   - If tests fail: Fix them and run again (never proceed with failing tests)

9. Call reviewer to review your tests:
   - Use Task tool to call `test-automation-reviewer` subagent
   - Provide paths to request and response files
   - Iterate with reviewer until approved

## Key principles

- **Tests must pass**: Never complete without running tests and verifying they pass
- **Database migrations**: Always run watch tool if backend schema changed
- **Speed is critical**: Structure tests to minimize steps while maximizing coverage
- **Follow conventions**: Adhere to patterns in [End-to-End Tests](mdc:.cursor/rules/end-to-end-tests/e2e-tests.mdc)
- **Realistic user journeys**: Test scenarios that reflect actual user behavior
