# Implement Task Workflow

## STEP 0: Read Task Assignment

**Read `current-task.json` in your workspace root** to get:
- `request_file_path`: Full path to your request file
- `prd_path`: Path to PRD (if Product Increment task)
- `product_increment_path`: Path to Product Increment (if applicable)
- `task_number_in_increment`: Your task number in the increment (if applicable)
- `title`: Task title

**Then read the request file** from the path in `request_file_path`.

**Request file contains**:
- Task description/instructions
- Any additional context from Tech Lead

If this is a Product Increment task, also read the PRD and Product Increment files.

## STEP 1: Create Todo List - DO THIS NOW!

**CALL TodoWrite TOOL WITH THIS EXACT JSON - COPY AND PASTE**:

```json
{
  "todos": [
    {"content": "Understand context and catch up efficiently", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Understanding context and catching up"},
    {"content": "Study relevant rules for the task at hand", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Studying relevant rules"},
    {"content": "Research existing patterns for this task type", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Researching existing patterns"},
    {"content": "Implement task [name of the task from request file]", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Implementing task"},
    {"content": "Validate implementation builds and fix all static code analysis warnings", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating implementation"},
    {"content": "Validate translations (frontend tasks only)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating translations"},
    {"content": "Mark task as Ready for Review", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Marking task as Ready for Review"},
    {"content": "Critically evaluate remaining tasks and update plan", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Evaluating remaining tasks"},
    {"content": "Call /complete/task to signal completion", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Calling completion command"}
  ]
}
```

After creating base todo, expand "Implement task" with subtasks from Product Increment file (if applicable).

## Workflow Steps

**STEP 2**: Study rules (`.cursor/rules/backend/` or `.cursor/rules/frontend/`)

**STEP 3**: Research similar implementations in codebase

**STEP 4**: Implement each subtask, use **build** and **test** MCP tools

**STEP 5**: Run **check MCP tool**, fix all warnings (must pass)

**STEP 6**: Frontend only - validate translations

**STEP 7**: Edit Product Increment file: `[In Progress]` → `[Ready for Review]`

**STEP 8**: Re-read Product Increment, update plan if needed

**STEP 9**: Call `/complete/task`, provide summary and response

## REMINDER: Use Exact TodoWrite JSON

**✅ DO: Copy the JSON from STEP 0**

**❌ DON'T: Create custom todo format**
